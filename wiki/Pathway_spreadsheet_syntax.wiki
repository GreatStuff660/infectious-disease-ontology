This page describes the syntax for pathway spreadsheets.

= Introduction =

Each spreadsheet is an excel workbook with possibly multiple sheets. Within each sheet there are a number of blocks. 

A block is a rectangular region of a spreadsheet that is labeled with a known set of column headers. Subsequent rows are considered to be part of the block until either
 * The first cell of a row is blank
 * Another set of column headers is found in the row

Font and cell styles are _currently_ ignored.

Column headers are compared on a case-insensitive basis.

= Kinds of blocks =

== Sheet information block ==
Column headers: *Spreadsheet id*,	*About*, *Date Created*, *Last edited*, *Editors*

The purpose of this block is to provide information about the curation and interpretation of the sheet.

This block can have 1 or more rows. The first row supplies the information specified by the headers.

 * *Spreadsheet id*: A string uniquely labeling this sheet within the workbook. Case insensitive.
 * *About*: Documenting, in plain english,  what has been recorded on the sheet
 * *Date Created*: The date the sheet was created. 
 * *Last Edited*: The date the sheet was last edited
 * *Editors*: A list of names of editors, separated by ";"

Subsequent rows are interpreted as properties/values with the first column being the property name and the second column being the value.

Currently only one property is understood:
 * *Uses entities from*: A list of spreadsheet ids separated by ";", that define the scope of handle lookup within the sheet,  When resolving handles, first the handles on the current sheet will be searched, then the handles on each subsequent sheet listed will be searched, until a match is found.

Example:

|| *Spreadsheet id* || *About* || *Date Created* || *Last edited* || *Editors* ||
|| TLR4-02 || LPS recognition and signaling via TLR4 || 5/22/09 || 6/24/09 || Anna Maria; Alan||
|| Uses entities from  || TLR4-01 ||  ||  || ||

== Handle block ==
Column headers: *handle*, *Entities*, *Kind*, *class*, *super(s)*

The purpose of this block is to define short names for entities that will be referred to in definitions of e.g. processes and complexes, and associate them with existing ontology terms. 

 * *handle*: A name for an entity that will be referred to in a subsequent definition. Handles must match the regular expression [A-Za-z0-9-]+, that is they can use the upper and lower case letters, numbers, and "-".
 * *Entities*: A natural language description of the entity for documenting purposes.
 * *Kind*: A tag describing the kind of entity, currently uncontrolled, also for documentation purposes. Some current values: Gene product, post transcriptional modification, aminoacid, modified aminoacid, complex, complex modified
 * *class*: An identifier for the entity. Usually OBO style identifier _namespace:id_. However other forms may be recognized. Currently ids that start with "PF" are understood as PFAM identifiers.
 * *super(s)*: In the case where the entity will be MIREOTed from the source ontology, and the superclass isn't obvious from the _Kind_, an identifier for the parent class.

Example:

|| *handle* || *Entities* || *Kind* || *class* || *super(s)* ||
|| IRK4 || IRAK4 || Gene product || PRO:000001780 ||  ||
|| IRK1 || IRAK1 || Gene product || PRO:000001782 ||  ||
